# ROS 2 Lyrical Tutorial Environment

Welcome! This repository contains a fully containerized ROS 2 Lyrical environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Clone the repository
Open a terminal on your host machine and clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gglaspell/lyrical_tutorial.git
cd lyrical_tutorial
```

### 2. Allow GUI Passthrough (Linux Host Only)
Because you will be using graphical tools like Turtlesim and RViz2, you need to allow the Docker container to talk to your host's display server. Run this once per session:
```bash
xhost +local:root
```

### 3. Start the Environment
Build and start the container in the background using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
*(Note: The first time you run this, it will take a few minutes to download and build the ROS 2 Lyrical image).*

### 4. Enter the Container
To start working, open a shell inside the running container using `docker compose exec`. This runs `entrypoint.sh` so ROS 2, your workspace overlay, and colcon helpers are all sourced automatically:
```bash
docker compose exec ros2-lyrical /entrypoint.sh bash
```
You should now see your terminal prompt change. You are inside the container! All the ROS 2 environment variables are automatically sourced for you.

### 5. Opening Multiple Terminals
ROS 2 requires running multiple nodes in separate terminals at the same time. Open a new terminal tab on your host machine and simply run the same command again:
```bash
docker compose exec ros2-lyrical /entrypoint.sh bash
```

## 📂 Where to write your code
Your code should go inside the `ros2_ws/src/` directory. This folder is bind-mounted from your host machine into the container.
* This means you can use your favorite code editor (like VS Code) on your **host machine** to edit the files, and then compile/run them **inside the container**.
* If the container is destroyed, your code is safe!

## 🛑 Stopping the Environment
When you are done for the day, exit your container terminals and run:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### 🟡 Beginner: Client Libraries
*Write your first ROS 2 code in Python and/or C++.*

- [x] Using `colcon` to build packages *(✅ `colcon` is pre-installed in the Docker image. You should still read this tutorial to learn the `colcon build` command!)*
- [x] Creating a workspace *(✅ The `ros2_ws/src` folder is already created and mapped to the container)*
- [ ] Creating a package
- [ ] Writing a simple publisher and subscriber (C++)

- [ ] Writing a simple service and client (Python)
- [ ] Creating custom `msg` and `srv` files
- [ ] Implementing custom interfaces
- [ ] Using parameters in a class (C++)
- [ ] Using parameters in a class (Python)
- [ ] Using `ros2doctor` to identify issues
- [ ] Creating and using plugins (C++)

### 🟠 Intermediate
*Level up with complex system architectures and foundational tools.*

- [x] Managing dependencies with `rosdep` *(✅ Note: `rosdep update` is handled by the Dockerfile, but read this to learn how to use `rosdep install` for new packages)*
- [ ] Creating a custom action
- [ ] Writing an action server and client (C++)
- [ ] Writing an action server and client (Python)
- [ ] Composing multiple nodes in a single process
- [ ] Monitoring for parameter changes
- [ ] **Launch tutorials:** Creating advanced launch files
- [ ] **tf2 tutorials:** Understanding coordinate frames and transforms

### 🔴 Advanced
*Explore under-the-hood configurations and performance tuning.*

- [ ] Enabling topic statistics
- [ ] Using Fast DDS Discovery Server
- [ ] Implementing a custom memory allocator
- [ ] Security tutorials (Setting up SROS2)
- [ ] Recording a bag from a node (C++)
- [ ] Reading from a bag file (C++)

### 🟣 Demos
*See ROS 2 in action with practical, real-world examples.*

- [ ] Quality of Service (QoS) features and degradation testing
- [ ] Managing nodes with Managed Nodes (Lifecycle nodes)
- [ ] Real-time programming in ROS 2 (Pendulum demo)
